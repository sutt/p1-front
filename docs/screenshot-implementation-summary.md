     - `screenshotEnabled` - Toggle for feature
     - `screenshotStatus` - Display capture status/feedback
   - Updated `handleAIChatSubmit()`:
     - Captures screenshot when enabled
     - Validates screenshot data
     - Includes in AI request payload
     - Shows status messages during capture
   - Added UI checkbox in AI widget to enable/disable screenshots
   - Checkbox is disabled when map is not shown (requires map context)

## How to Use (Frontend)

### For Users:
1. Enable the map background (Map Settings widget)
2. Open the AI Assistant widget
3. Check the "Screenshot" checkbox
4. Type your message and click Send
5. The screenshot will be captured and sent with your message

### Debug Logging:
To control debug logging, edit `/home/user/gauntlet/pkgs/p1-front/my-react-app/src/services/screenshotCapture.ts:20`:

```typescript
/** Module-wide debug flag - set to true to enable debug logging */
export const DEBUG_SCREENSHOT = true; // Change to false to disable
```

When enabled, you'll see detailed logs in the browser console:
- Viewport extraction timing
- Map center, zoom, and bounds
- Coverage area calculations
- Canvas capture timing
- Image size and format
- Validation results

## Backend Integration Required

The backend needs to implement the following to support this feature:

### 1. Accept Updated Request Format

```typescript
interface AIRequest {
  user: string;
  message: string;
  canvasState: any;
  model?: string;
  screenshot?: {
    data: string;          // base64 encoded
    format: 'png' | 'jpeg';
    capturedAt: string;    // ISO timestamp
    viewportInfo: {
      width: number;
      height: number;
      mapCenter: [number, number]; // [lat, lng]
      mapZoom: number;
      mapBounds?: {
        north: number;
        south: number;
        east: number;
        west: number;
      };
    };
  };
}
```

### 2. Validate Screenshot Data

See `docs/screenshot-capture-feature.md` Section 0, Step 2 for validation function.

Key validations:
- Base64 format
- Size limits (recommended max 10MB)
- Geographical bounds (lat: -90 to 90, lng: -180 to 180, zoom: 0 to 22)

### 3. Calculate Coverage Area

See `docs/screenshot-capture-feature.md` Section 0, Step 3 for calculation function.

Example output:
- Zoom 15 ≈ 2-3 miles
- Zoom 13 ≈ 8-10 miles
- Zoom 18 ≈ 0.3 miles

### 4. Format Context for AI

Include geographical context in the prompt sent to the AI model:

```typescript
const context = `The user is viewing a map centered at ${lat}, ${lng}
at zoom level ${zoom}, covering approximately ${coverageArea} miles.
The visible area shows locations between ${bounds.north}°N to ${bounds.south}°S
and ${bounds.west}°W to ${bounds.east}°E.

User message: ${userMessage}`;
```

### 5. Send to AI Vision Model

For Claude:
```typescript
{
  model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: [
      {
        type: "image",
        source: {
          type: "base64",
          media_type: "image/png", // or image/jpeg
          data: screenshot.data
        }
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        text: contextWithMessage
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### 6. Handle Errors Gracefully

- If screenshot processing fails, fall back to text-only mode
- Return helpful error messages to the user
- Log failures for monitoring

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the feature**:
   - Enable the map background
   - Open AI Assistant
   - Enable screenshot checkbox
   - Send a message about the map location
   - Check browser console for debug logs
   - Verify the screenshot checkbox is disabled when map is off

4. **Check the request payload**:
   - Open browser DevTools Network tab
   - Send a message with screenshot enabled
   - Inspect the POST request to `/api/ai/chat`
   - Verify `screenshot` field is present with all required data

### Expected Debug Output:

```
[ScreenshotCapture] === Starting screenshot capture ===
[ScreenshotCapture] Extracting viewport info from map
[ScreenshotCapture] Viewport info extracted: {center: "37.779800, -122.419400", zoom: "15.00", ...}
[ScreenshotCapture] Coverage area at zoom 15.00: 2.45 miles
[ScreenshotCapture] Capturing element: DIV app
[ScreenshotCapture] Canvas created: 1920x1080
[ScreenshotCapture] Screenshot captured: JPEG, 245.67 KB
[ScreenshotCapture] === Screenshot capture successful ===
[AI Chat] Screenshot captured successfully
[AI Chat] Metrics: {captureTime: 523.4, imageSize: 251582}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Requires map to be enabled** - Screenshot checkbox is disabled when map is hidden
2. **No preview** - User doesn't see the screenshot before sending (future enhancement)
3. **Fixed capture target** - Always captures `#app` element (could be made configurable)
4. **No retry mechanism** - If capture fails, user must resend the message
5. **Backend not implemented yet** - Backend needs to be updated to accept and process screenshots

## Future Enhancements

See `docs/screenshot-capture-feature.md` Section "Future Enhancements" for ideas:
- Screenshot preview before sending
- Selective element capture
- Screenshot history in conversation
- Video/GIF capture
- Annotation tools
- Multi-screenshot support

## Performance Notes

- Screenshot capture typically takes 300-800ms depending on viewport size
- Images are automatically resized to max 1920x1080
- JPEG quality is set to 0.8 for good balance of quality/size
- Typical screenshot size: 150-400 KB

## Cost Considerations for Backend

- Vision API calls cost more than text-only
- Screenshots increase payload size significantly
- Recommend rate limiting screenshot requests
- Consider user quotas or premium feature flag
