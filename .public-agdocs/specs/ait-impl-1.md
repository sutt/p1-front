Implement a minimalist proof of concept of the aitool feature described in docs/aitool-plan.md.
- this proof of concept should handle "add two rectangle to the canvas" and will be tested for this.

IMPORTANT: remember to read through the docs/aitool-plan.md for the guidelines.

### Guidelines
- Add a simple chat in the tools section, below the "Shape Tools".
- Wire up the XHR request to the backend.
- Create a mock example of a response from the server which will call the frontend function to perform the "add two rectangles to the canvas" request.
