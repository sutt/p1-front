Add a pop-out widget in the bottom right which displays the coords of the mouse/cursor.

Display for both canvas and map
-  canvas: the number coords (x,y) of the viewport for the canvas and the zoom level (rounded 2 decimal places)
- map: the lat/long coordinates (rounded 4 decimal places) and the zoom level of the current setting on the map.

The widget should be off by default and can be turned on the maps widget with a toggle button.
