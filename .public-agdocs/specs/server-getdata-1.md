In DemoFigma, Implement a connection to a server to get the inital shapes data.

For now, the server route will be on 127.0.0.1:8000/shapes but add these configs to an .env for future modification.

The shapes data should load from this endpoint when the page loads. 

Create a button at the top row in the menu setting "Get Data" which will replace the existing client-side data with the data pulled from the server's endpoint.

Console log any errors fetching or converting data.
