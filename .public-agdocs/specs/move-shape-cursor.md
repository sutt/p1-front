Adjust the cursor display logic for the following conditions:
- for drag and drop move shape: when shape is selected, display the cursor as the "grab hand" when the cursor is over the selected shape. This should occur even when "select mode" is activated where the default cursor style is "pointer finger"
- for "move shape" mode the cursor should display as "pointer finger"
