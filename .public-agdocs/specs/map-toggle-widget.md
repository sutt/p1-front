modify the mapbox map display attribute to be controlled by a toggle or widget on the ui.
- add the toggle widget as a floating element in the top right, not connected to the menu bar with an icon that hints at the concept of a map. clicking this button should pop out a larger widget (just like the ai-chat and users-online features). For starters have this widget have one button a toggle which enables the map to be displayed
- the map is off when the canvas loads by default. The map tiles should not be rendering or being requested until the toggle is turned on.
