In DemoFigma, implement the rendering of shapes: circle and square onto the canvas.

Functionality: 
- develop a data structure to represent the coords of where the shapes live on the canvas
    - note: in future iterations, shapes will be able to be moved on the canvas.
- hard code the following shapes onto the canvas:
    - one rectangle to be topleft (100,100) with height width of (200, 300)
    - one circle to be at center (600,400)  with radius of 100.
